            <h1> HISTORY OF AYETORO OKE</h1>
            <p>
              <img src="images/dahomey3.png" alt="" class="float-left img-fluid" alt="dahomey 3"> 

               According to oral history, Ayetoro Gegun originated near a
                town called Oyo-Oro. It was a big town but due to
                prevailing war, at that time, the in habitants of that time the habitants of the town
                were scattered. Hence, today we have Ayetoro located in
                different parts of Yoruba land. For examples, Ayetoro
                Fidiremi, Ayetoro Egbado, Ayetoro Gbade, Ayetoro Ile, etc
                As regards the present Ayetoro-Oke, their forefathers
                originally migrated from Ayetoro-lle near Iwere-Ile as a
                result of Dahomey war. They were looking for safety and
                this place (Ayetoro-Oke) was found to be suitable as there
                were and still are many rocks that could serve as places of
                protection, in case of sudden attacks from enemies waging
                war. Ogunronbi was the fore father of Ayetoro people and a
                brave hunter who used to climb tree as a hunter waiting for
                an elephant to kill and that was and still is the reason why
                they used to refer to Ayetoro people as Omo Gegun.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the reign of Jelemi the Dahomians waged war
                against Ayetoro-lle unexpectedly and this led to the
                movement to Ayetoro-Oke people to their present location
                till this day. So, Jelemi was the Baale (King) that led the
                people of Ayetoro Ile to this present Ayetoro-Oke. He was
                the eight Baale of Ayetoro-Ile but died at Ayetoro-Oke.
                Ayetoro-Oke is situated on a high mountainous area,
                near Okeho, the headquarters of Kajola Local Government.
                The mountain is called lgbo-Are because of ldahomey war
                where they met llero peoples during the reign of Elero
                Akanmu. Elero Akanmu informed the then Alaafin
                Oladigbolu and he ordered the Elero to accommodate the
                people of Ayetoro-lle now Ayetoro-Oke.
                Elero Akanmu accepted these people to be living together
                at Igbo-Are, they were together for years. After some years,
                the Ilero people left the place without notifying their visitor
                but Elero Akanmu had died during this time.
                Today, if one is not told, hardly could someone differentiate
                Ayetoro-Oke from Okeho. In the same vein, hardly could
                anybody differentiate Iwere-Oke, Ilaji-Oke from Ayetoro-
                Oke. This Is because chains of houses have linked these
                communities together and they have been living together
                harmoniously.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was a Shea butter in Ayetoro-Oke, but its stump
                exists still at Ayetoro market till today. It was and still a
                taboo for anybody to use it to make fire. Gegun of Ayetoro
                (Afolabi Tuku) used to hunt at lgbo-Are where his citizens
                were doing farming
                Gegun of Ayetoro has one Idol called Orisa nla and it has a
                spiritual leader called “Abore" in Yoruba language. Gegun
                of Ayetoto must not drink palm wine due to mythologIcal
                belief. The people of Ayetoro built a house for this Idol at
                Ayetoro market during that period and they used to offer
                sacrifices for it once in a year.
            </p>
                Gegun has a masquerade called “orejo”. This masquerade

                according to oral history Was initiated/founded by a hunter
                inside hole, with sword beside this masquerade. The hunter it to the king and it
                become and become Gegun masquerade up till date.

                Christianity and Islam are the major religions in the town
                with small number of people in idol worshiping. The
                Christianity and Islam religion bring development to the
                town. The first government primary School was established
                in 1943 with the name Baptist Primary School Ayetoro-
                Oke. Presently Ayetoro-Oke people have four (4) public
                primary schools with three public secondary schools.
                The first Arabic school in Oke-Ogun started in Ayetoro-
                Oke with the name Nurudeen Islamiya Ayetoro-Oke.
                The First Church was established in some decades ago
                while the First Mosque was established a few decades back.
                The town has one (1) Maternity and one (1) Dispensary
