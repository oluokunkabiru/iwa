            <p>
              <h3>LOCATION AND GEOGRAPHY</h3>
  <img src="images/okeogunn1.png" class="float-left img-fluid" alt="">
Iwa LCDA which was recently carved out from Kajola
Local Government Area of Oyo State is located at longitude
200 E and 70 400 E and latitude 30180 and 20350  its an area 
built on a ridge with lattude ranging trom 150- 275m
(Adeniyi and Ogundijo). The geology or the area consists
of the basement complex, mainly the metamorphic type of
the pre-Cambrian age. The rock components are covered
with weathered (Regolith Akintola, 1994).
            </p>
            <p>
The soil of Iwa LCDA/region belongs to a major group	
called the tropical Ferruginous soil. The soil generally have
low nutrient holding capacity due to their location and with
exchange capacities of between 5.0 and 12.0 millimeter-
equivalent per 100 grain of dry soil (Aweto, 1994).
Iwa Local Development Area enjoys the West African
Monsoonal climatic type marked by two distinct seasons.
The raining Season occurs between March and October
when the moist monsoonal wind from the Atlantic Ocean
blows over the region. On the other hand, the area
experiences, dry seasons between November and February
due to the influence of the dry, dust-laden north-east trade
winds from the Sahara desert (Emielu, 2000).
            </p>
            <p>
However, monthly and yearly values of rainfall generally
fluctuate. For instance, a value of 15Imm was recorded for
the month of April, 1997 while the month of August, 2011
recorded 187.5mm (NMS, 2011, cited in OYSG, 2011).
<img src="images/okeogun2.png" class="float-right img-fluid" alt="">
The mean temperatures are highest at the end of thee
harmattan (averaging 28C), that is from the middle of
November to the onset of the rains in the middle of March.
Even during the rainfall months, average temperatures are
relatively high, between 24C and 25°C, while annual
fluctuation of temperature is about 6°C (OYSG, 2011).
Geographically, the Iwa LCDA is bounded by the Kajola
Local Government Area, Itesiwaju local Government
Area, 1ganna LCDA, 1ganna and Iwajowa Local
Government Area. Also, Iwa Local Council Development
Area is located at the suburb area in Oke-Ogun region with
Its administrative headquarters located at llero and other
major towns are Ayetoro, Iwere-Oke and Ilaji-Oke which
are surrounded by many villages.
            </p>
Officially, the actual demarcation between Iwa Local
Council Development Area and Kajola Local Government
Area is still being worked upon by the office of Surveyor
General of Oyo State as at the time of writing this book.



<h3>IWA IN RETROSPECTION (1982-2017)</h3>
<p>
In 1979, Kajola and what later became Iwajowa Local
Government, in 1997, existed as one Local Government
constituencies and part of one Federal constituency.
The Local Governments remained unchanged or undivided
for more than four decades. The three state constituencies in
the old Kajola Local Government are constituency I which
composed of Okeho, Ilua, Imia, Isemi-Ile and numerous
other localities.
</p>
<p>
Constituency II was made up of llero, Ilaji-Oke, Iwere-Oke,
Ayetoro-Oke and numerous other localities on lero land.
Constituency II composed of Iganna, Iwere-Ile, ljio, Ilaji-
ile, Ayetoro-lle, Idiko-lle, Idiko-Ago, ltasa, Ayegun,
Elekokan, Galadima, ete.
The struggles and efforts for splitting the former Kajola
Local Government into three separate Local Government
based on the existing constituencies dated back to the year
1982, when the then Governor of Oyo State, Late Chief
Bola lge carved out a Local Government named Kajola
East Local Government with headquarters in lganna.
Constituency III was made a Local Government of its own.</p>
<p>
He promised that constituency II would become a Local
Government in 1983, if he was re-elected. Pending 1983,
the year of promise by the State (Governor, this constituency
was one of the fourteen Local governments established h
the Oyo State House of Assembly in 1982. See Appendix B
Local Government Amendment (No.2) Law 1982. The
experiment was short lived with the abolishment of all the
newly created Local governments in 1984.
By the year 1997, Constituency Ill was carved into a Local
Government of its Own and named Iwajowa Local
Government. Iwere-lle eventually emerged as its
headquarters, instead of lganna. Constituency III retained
its own state constituency up till today. Kajola Local
Government was existing with the two old state
Constituencies.</p>
<p>
In 2002, the then House of Assembly, during the regime of
Alhaji Lamidi Onaolapo Adesina, gave a positive response
to demand for a separate Local Government. However, the
Local Government was about to settle down when his
successor Governor Senator Adewolu Ladoja suspended it.
See harmonized lists of new Local Government by the
House Functionaries and Executive on 22nd of May 2002,
No. 30, Annexure C.</p>
<p>
His Excellency, Senator Isiaq Abiola Ajimobi (Koseleri of
Oyo State) implemented this age-long dream by sending a
bill to the House of Assembly seeking the creation of thirty-
five Local Council Development Areas.
This laudable achievement required passion for grassroots
development and boldness on the part of the Executive
Governor of the State for the vision to be actualized.
Quite interesting, on 27th of February, 2017, the good news
hit the air-waves of our mass-media that IWA Local
Council Development Area was created among other thirty-
five entities in the state.</p>

<h3>MEANING OF IWA</h3>
<p>

principal towns, in the Local Council Development Area;

<p>
The IWA Local Council Development Area is blessed with
abundant human and natural resources. About 80% of the
inhabitants are Arable Farmers. the area ranks one of the
best among the food and cash crop producing areas in the
state, hence the Food Basket appellation and that
informed the Federal Government to locate the
headquarters of two of its principal Agriculture project and
Agency in the (IWA) headquarter Ilero. The Ogun-Osun
River Basin Development Authority and the National
Agriculture Land Development Authority (NALDA). Also,
the state owned Oyo State Agricultural Development
Project (OYSADEP).</p>
<p>
  IWA Local Council Development
Area can boast of several thousands of hectares of cash crop
farmlands that are begging for further development. e.g.
Cashew.
To cap it all, Asphobilitc-Salphalt was discovered in large
quantity in the area and indigenous companies have started
the blasting of the gem, which 1s being used for the
manufacturing of vehicle insulators or other related
industrial items like electrical and vehicular fittings, and
refrigerators. Certain brands of the valuable stones are also
being used as decorative items of residential structures e.g.
Tile materials.
