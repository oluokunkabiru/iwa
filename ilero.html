              <h1>HISTORY OF ILERO</h1>
          
          <p>
            Ilero was founded in early 18th century by a man called Alawotan. 
            Alawotan was a great hunter that used to move from place to place looking 
            for animals to kill. Alawotan hailed from Ilaro, Ogun State. He moved to the old 
            Ilero called "Ilero ahoro" through his professional effort in searching for animals. 
            There was outbreak of war all over the land that made him returning back his home town 
            Ilaro difficult. The man, Alawotan eventually settled on the top of a gigantic mountainous
             rock (òkè -Ila) which was recognized as "Ilero ahoro" till date for his normal business. 
             <img src="images/hunter2.png" alt=" hunter 1" class="float-right img-fluid ">
          </p>
          <p>
            One day, he woke up and saw some people around his settlement because they 
            observed bails of smoke coming from his camp. His initial thought was they might be 
            warrior coming to attack him, but moving closer to him, he realized that they were people 
            that ran for there lives from Ila Orangun due to the war. He received them and protected them 
            for many years. As time went on they began to increase in numbers. 
            This great hunter called Alawotan now realized that as they were paying respect to him he would not be able to do his work again if he made him king. He then consulted Ifa Oracle who selected among people from Ila Orangun as head of the settlement. The Oracle also told him that, that place would not accommodate them in future because more people would still come. It means the town would be flooded by new others in future (ILU ERO). It was this ERO that was shortened to Ilero. 
            As the Oracle predicted, in no distance time, people started trooping to the town called 
            Ile-ero. Many people from Iwere Ile, Ìlàjì Ilé and Ayetoro ilé came to settle on the little piece 
            of land that was suitable for living and Farming on top of the rock in searching for peace and 
            protection. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The factor of searching for peace and protection astrologically increased the population
             comprising indigenes and immigrants led to resettlement on the present land called Ilero. 
            The search for  better place to settle took them as far as Agunrege, Igbadi Mountain was the
             terminal and still the significant structure now to be mentioned. All these happened during 
             the reign of Elero Ayoola. There were twelve Elero before Elero Ayoola.

             When the present Ilero was discovered, the people of oke Ila <b> (Ilero ahoro)</b>
              moved with joy and fears of many wild animals that would attack them both day and night. 
             Elero Ayoola took his people with his chiefs like Jagun, Olukotun, Olukosin,  
             Sobaloju, Ajeji Moganji, Agoro and others to the land. As they were going, 
             they consulted Ifa Oracle who told them to move until they got to present 
             place before the Oracle told them to stop there if they could not go further again. 
          </p>
          <p>
             Their first night at Ilero was sweet because they had another twins that night. Elero 
             Ayoola made a lot of sacrifices to protect the town from the attack of enemies, such that, 
             anybody that came to attack them would not see there way until the devilish plan was jettisoned
              and turned back. Elero Ayoola died and Elero Olayanju Akanbi ascended the throne 
              (exact date not established) 
              Oba Olayanju lived for many years on the throne before he died. After the death of Olayanju 
              Akanbi, came oba Solomon Adedokun Ajayi V as the Elero. His reign brought a lot of development 
              to the town, in terms of education, economic and soco-cultural advancements. Oba Solomon Ajayi 
              Olabiyi died in 2017 and his death brought Ilero to the installation of new Elero of Ilero, oba 
              Wasiu Oyedele Saka Ige Onisa Olokolonigi II on 24th July 2018.
