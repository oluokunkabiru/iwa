              <h1>HISTORY OF ILAJI OKE</h1>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Ilaji ilé was founded by Akodudu, the son of Aláàfin in 18th century,  
            he was a great warrior who fought Fulani, Idahomey to a hold for Idiko Ilé. He has a 
            son called Odugbemi who took the throne after his demise. There were some other Obas before
             the Fulani /Idahomey wars broke the towns which led to safety run of the people to various places,
             ing the reign of Oba Okegbemi Amodo. They ran to a place called Agbamo near Okeho. They were warmly
              received by the then Onjo of Okeho. </p>
              <p>Ilaji people were given parcels of land for farming and other comfort facilities of that time. 
            That left the Agbamo and returned back to ilaji Ile due to a little misunderstanding between
             them and people of Okeho, during a festival, at Okeho. Though, some did not return to ilaji Ile 
             and didn’t stay back at Agbamo, but moved to Ehinkunle Oshohun, the ascentral home of the people 
             of Ilero. </p>
             <p> This time, they were led by Oba Kobolape Agunleyinju.  Their arrival was sudden but not surprise 
            to the people of Ilero because an Ifá Oracle had earlier prophesied the arrival of the different 
            people to the place, hence “ÌLÚ ÈRÒ”  (ILERO) . The then Elero of Ilero, Oba Ayoola gave a better 
            reception to the people of Agbamo (ilaji ilé),  where they narrated their ordeal to them. Ilero people
             on whose land they settled gave them parcel of land for farming. Since they knew that it would take 
             some time for the farm produce to come out, they also allowed the people of ilaji Ile to take all 
             they wanted to eat from there own farm. These kind gesture made ilaji ilé people to decide to remain 
             with them at Ehinkunle Oshohun.
             <img src="images/dahomey2.png" alt="" class="float-left img-fluid"> 
             The ilaji at Ehinkunle Oshohun now moved to where they are now and preferred to be called 
             ilaji oke meaning “in between two mountains”.  Since then, the people of ilaji oke and Ilero
              have been living together in peace and harmony till today. 
            This was followed in sequence by Oba Lawoore Akanni (1). Oba James Olaoye Abiola (1) Ọba Lamidi 
            Olatedun Abimbola Olawoore (II) and Ọba Jeremiah Oyeboade Oladosun Abiola (II) who installed as 
            the Bajigan of ilaji oke early this year,  as incumbent till date of writing this book.

            The main occupation of Ilaji oke people are farming hunting, fishing as well as 
            trading as their ancestors did several years ago. The town’s local economy is largely
             sustained by farmers, hunters, traders weavers and craft men. Some households also rear 
             sheep and goats till today. 

            Traditional crafts practiced in Ilaji oke include cotton weaving by old women, dyeing,
             leaders work and metallurgy. Ilaji oke is also an ancestral home of Ọranyan, Ogiyan, Sango,
              Ogun and egungun Idol worshipers. 
           </p>

            <p>
              There was a market in the town in the past that people used to referred to as Oja Ilaji
               (Ilaji market). People from different towns and states do come there every five days to buy 
               <img src="images/yam market.png" alt="" class="float-right img-fluid">

               and sell. There was popular saying that “Oja Ilaji mo benikan ó wà”  meaning that Ilaji market 
               not know whether somebody did not come as a result of plenty people that do patronize the market. 
              There are some of the things they used to sell in the market ;Kudi cloth, Elu (dye mould, 
                Orogbo òwú òtútù (cotton wool), isu (yam), obi (colanut), Elubo (yam flour). They used to 
                sell local pap (Eko oko), àkàrà ẹwà. However, they operate trade by barter, that is exchanged 
                of what you have for what you need. For example dye mould for either cakes or pap and many other 
                things till the advent of local tender (money).
            </p>
            <p>
              There was an Idol called Osanla that they used to worship then, every year. During the worship,
               eye igun (vulture) do come as a sign of acceptance of the ritual. 

              A sizeable percentage of the people are into educational sector as a tutors and 
              lecturers at various Learning center within and outside the community. Ilaji oke is bounded in the east by Iwere 
              oke and west by Ayetoro oke and Ilero. It has boundaries line in Southwest with Iganna LCDA Iganna. 
              Igala, Igbo and some other foreign tribal groups are within Ilaji oke that are into farming. Whoever 
              that knows Ilaji oke may be sitting on numerous valuable precious stones which may attract foreign investors
              in the nearest future. Perhaps these may be a pointer to robust future economic empowerment of the town.
              These are some popular mountain in town àpáta Ango (Ango mountains).
