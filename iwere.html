            <h1>HISTORY OF IWERE OKE</h1>
        
          <p>
            Initially both Iwere-le and Iwere-Oke were members of
              the same family but the two towns became separated as a
              result of Dahomey war. Akintola Agboju the whole with
              Egbeji was the progenitor of Oniwere of Iwere. Iwere-lle
              town was sacked and its chieftaincy and the son of Alaafin.
              People sojourned on a mountain they christened lwere-
              Oke. The town is the guest of the Elero of llero who had
              received the town warmly at the time of their migration
              during the Dahomian invasion of the town in 18 Century
              The Elero of llero sought the permission and consent of
              Alaafin of Oyo and granted the parcel of land to the town
              for farming and the place is called Awotan. This Awotan is
              the land used for farming by the founder of Ilero
              "Alawotan
              <img src="images/dahomey1.png" alt="dahomey3" class="float-right img-fluid">
          </p>
          <p>
            After the Dahomey war, some people moved back to Iwere-
            Ile and some settled down at Iwere-Oke. Two different
            views were obtained during the cause of writing this book.
            The first view said; during the time of Ajani as Oniwere of
            Iwere-lle, Ajani was persuaded to unite Iwere-Ile and
            Iwere-Oke together but Iwere-Oke people resisted. That
            fact prompted Oba Ajani to seck the intervention of the
            Alaafin of Oyo, but inspite of the Alaafin's intervention,
            Iwere-Oke people still remained adamant, at the meeting
            with Iwere-Oke people. The Alaafin passed a question to
            which Iwere-Oke people answered that Akinyemi was the
            royal father that would lead them. The answer did not go
            well with Ajani, because he felt that Akinyemi his brother
            was making things difficult for him. Alaafin of Oyo now
            ordered Ajani to leave them and Alaafin finally blessed
            them to settle at the Iwere-Oke, their present site. Akinyemi
            appoint Adejumo as Jagunmolu of lwere-Oke to lead
            Twere-Oke as a community,
            After the death of first Jagunmolu, Chief Odunrinde was
            the second Jagunmolu. The third Jagunmolu of lwere-Oke
            was Fawole. Fourth Jagunmolu was known as Gbadegesin.

          </p>
          <P>
            These are other Chiefs:- Asaba of lwere-Oke, Elemo of
            Iwere-Oke, Osi of Iwere-Oke, Odofin of Iwere-Oke,
            Oninayin of were Oke, Aro of Iwere-COke, Eselu of Iwere-
            Oke, Baalo of Iwere-Oke, Iyalode of Iwere-Oke, Otun
            Iyalode of Iwere-Oke, Balogun of Iwere-Oke, Eleede of
            were-Oke, lyaloja of lwere-Oke, Baale Agbe of Iwere-
            Oke.

          </P>
          <p>
            After the settlement of Iwere-Oke people there was scarcity
            of water and they complained to Elero of llero, The then
            Elero called Chief Aladikun to go and get source of water
            for the people of Iwere-Oke and the people moved from
            their former place to the area surrounding the new source
            for water. After three years of resettlement, Ayctoro people
            came as a new settler: people of Iwere-Oke now ordered
            one of their Chiefs to settle them at their former place where
            Ayetoro people were till today. He used Oko Okanlu (native
            hoe) which any King of Ayetoro must never see again in his
            life time before they settled down.

          </p>
          <p>
            In another story of were-0ke, the people of Iwere-lle
            originated from le-lie, Akinola Agboju carried his people
            fron ile lfe to lwere-ile because of Kingship problem
            Contrary to the first view, Oba Olaniya carried people from
            Iwere-lle to Iwere-Oke because of Dahomey war in 18th
            Century After the people of lwere-Oke had settled down in
            the land given to them by Oba Ayoola the Elero of Ilero
            then, Ayinla and Oluale returned to Iwere-lle, and it
            remained only Olaniya at Iwere-Oke. After the returned of
            Oluale and Ayinla, they appointed first Mogaji to be the
            head of the town who was Akinteye Olaniya, followed by
            Popoola Olaniya, then Shittu Olaleru was appointed after
            the death of Popoola Olaniya followed by Chief Rasheed.
